      <h2>Understanding the AI Workflow Transformation</h2>
      <p>The landscape of business automation is undergoing a radical transformation. What was once a complex, engineering-heavy process is now becoming accessible to everyone, thanks to AI-powered workflow tools.</p>

      <h3>Key Trends Driving the Revolution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enterprise AI Integration</strong>: Major platforms like Microsoft Teams are embedding AI capabilities directly into collaboration tools.</li>
        <li><strong>No-Code/Low-Code Platforms</strong>: Non-technical users can now build complex automations in hours.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Agents</strong>: Systems that can not just generate text, but take meaningful actions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Security and Scalability</h3>
      <p>With great power comes great responsibility. The rise of AI workflows has also highlighted critical security considerations, particularly around platforms like n8n, which recently faced significant vulnerability challenges.</p>

      <h3>The Future of Workflow Automation</h3>
      <p>By 2028, experts predict that AI agents will manage up to 30% of business processes. This isn't just about efficiency—it&apos;s about creating intelligent systems that adapt, learn, and optimize in real-time.</p>

      <h3>Getting Started with AI Workflows</h3>
